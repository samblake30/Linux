## _General Description_
 * _Kubernetes is simply to automate our application infrastructure and make it easy to manage.So if we're using containers and we have this application infrastructure that's built on containers, Kubernetes makes it much easier to automate and manage that infrastructure. what containers really are because Kubernetes is all about managing containers. So at a high level, containers are simply something that wraps software and independent and portable packages. And when we wrap software in these independent in portable packages, what we're doing is we're making it easy to run that software consistently in a variety of environments and ensure that it runs the same way regardless of what kind of environment it's in. Let's Start with the basic Setup of Kubernetes cluster using the ```Kubeadm``` utility._
